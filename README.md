# **Attrition rate analysis**
author: "Sohom Das"


### Problem Statement

A large multinational organisation, employs at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. Every year, around 15% of the company's employees quit and must be replaced with new people. Management considers that this degree of attrition (workers leaving on their own or because they were sacked) is bad for the organization.

### Goal

You need to use a logistic regression to model the likelihood of attrition. The results will be utilized by management to determine what improvements should be made to their workplace in order to retain the majority of their employees.
